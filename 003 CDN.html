    * What id CDN?
    CDN stands for Content Delevary Network. A CDN is a system of distributed servers that hosts 
    resources such as image, css, javascript file etc.

    Companies like Microsoft, Google, Yahoo etc. have a free public CDN from which we can load jquery 
    instead of hosting it on our own web server. 

    * Benifit of using CDN:
    Distributed CDN server : 
        The jquery file can be downloaded from the CDN server that is closest to
    the user.

    * Browsing Caching : 
        JQuery is used on many popular websites, If use has already wisited a webpage 
    that uses a JQuery from the CDN. and if he arrives at your page, the JQuery file has already been 
    cached by the browser so there is no need to download it again.

    * Parallel downloads : 
        There is a browser limit on how many files can be currently downloaded from given domain. 
        This number can be varies from a given domain. This number can be varies from browser to browser

    * Reduce server load :
        The HTTP request for jquery file is handled by the CDN server, so the load on your web server 
        is reduced. This also means there is saving on your website bandwiths consumption which in turn
        will reduce your hosting cost.

    * Disadvantage : 
        Your client firewalls may block the CDN. So you may have to request your clients to whitelist
        the CDN.
